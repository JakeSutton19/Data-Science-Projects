#Book Recommendation Project



The goal of this project is to create a book recommendation system. It will be broken down into 3 different steps:
	
	1. Search for Books

	2. Create Book List

	3. Recommend Books


## Reference:

I used this lovely tutorial from Vic at DataQuest as the base of this project.
